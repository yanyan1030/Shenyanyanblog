1) IDENTIFY - the specific fear you have that’s underlying the stress.

2) DEFINE - the worst case scenario.

3) DEVELOP - a specific, step-by-step contingency plan for the worst case scenario.

4) ACCEPT - the worst case scenario and your contingency plan as a possibility. Get comfortable with both (so if it should happen, you won’t feel emotionally blindsided).

5) DETERMINE - what IS within your control that can impact the outcome you want.

6) DO - the things that are within your control to do.

7) LET GO - of everything else because it is not within your control (especially true if the final outcome you want is dependent on a 3rd party).


This is what I learn from Victor Chen, who I followd.
